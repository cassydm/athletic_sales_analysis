# athletic_sales_analysis
Module 5 Challenge due 6/17/24. Created by Cassy Miller


This module contains a folder for starter files and a folder for the final code. 

In the final code folder, athletic_sales_analysis_final.ipynb takes two csv files (athletic sales 2020 & athletic sales 2021) and by using groupby and pivot tables, transforms the data in a easier to digest format. 


*note that the csv files used in the final code are found in the starter code, resources folder.
